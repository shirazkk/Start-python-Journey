# Python Indentation

In programming, different languages use various methods to define code blocks:

- **Curly Braces:** Languages like C, C++, and Java use curly braces `{}` to define code blocks.
- **Semicolons:** Some languages use semicolons `;` to terminate statements, but not for block definitions.
- **Python's Approach:** Python uses whitespace (indentation) to indicate code structure. Consistent indentation is crucial for defining blocks of code such as the body of loops, functions, and conditional statements.

Python relies on indentation, not curly braces or semicolons, to control the flow of the program. Correct indentation ensures that the code runs as intended.
