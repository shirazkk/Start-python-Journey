# Python Comments

## Single-Line Comments
In Python, single-line comments are created using the `#` symbol. Everything after the `#` on that line is ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a greeting
```


## Multi-Line Comments in Python



Python does not have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax like some other programming languages. However, you can create multi-line comments in two common ways:

### Method 1: Consecutive Single-Line Comments
You can use multiple `#` symbols on consecutive lines to create a multi-line comment.

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# that spans across multiple lines.
# Each line begins with a `#` symbol.
