# Comparison Operators
In python Comparison Operators are use to compare two values and return boolean output `True` or `False`

There are some Comparison Operators

```python
a=2
b=2
print(a==b) #check a and b are equal or not output will be True
print(a!=b) #check a and b are not equal output will be False
print(a>b) #check a is greater than b? output will be False
print(a<b) #check a is less than b? output will be False
print(a<=b) #check a is less than and equal to b? output will be True becuase a is equal to b.
print(a>=b) #check a is greater  than or equal to b? output will be True.
```
