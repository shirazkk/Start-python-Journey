# Membership Operators:
These operators check whether the given word or int is present in variable or not.

**for example**
```python
a = "shiraz_aLi"
print("s" in data) # returns True
print("l" in data) # returns False bcz python is case sensitive so in our variable  L is capital that's why its return false 
print("L" in data) # returns True 
print("shiraz_ali" not in data) # returns false 
```
