# Arithmetic Operators

In Python, arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. Below are the commonly used arithmetic operators in Python:

## Operators

- **Addition Operator (`+`)**
- **Subtraction Operator (`-`)**
- **Multiplication Operator (`*`)**
- **Division Operator (`/`)**
- **Floor Division Operator (`//`)**
- **Modulus Operator (`%`)**
- **Exponentiation Operator (`**`)**

### Addition Operator (`+`)

The addition operator is used to add two values.

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)  # Output: 3
```

### Subtraction Operator (`-`)
The subtraction operator subtracts one value from another.

```python
a = 2
b = 2
print(a - b)  # Output: 0
```

### Multiplication Operator (*)
The multiplication operator multiplies two values.

```python

a = 3
b = 5
print(a * b)  # Output: 15
```

### Division Operator (`/`)
The division operator divides one value by another and returns the result as a float.

```python
Copy code
a = 3
b = 4
print(a / b)  # Output: 0.75
```

### Floor Division Operator (`//`)
The floor division operator divides the first operand by the second operand and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result. This effectively performs integer division and truncates any decimal portion.

```python
a = 3
b = 10
print(a // b)  # Output: 0
```
**Explanation:**
```
Calculation: 3 / 10 results in 0.3.
Floor Division: The // operator rounds 0.3 down to the nearest integer, which is 0.
```

### Modulus Operator (`%`)
The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of one value by another.

```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a % b)  # Output: 1
```

### Exponentiation Operator (`**`)
The exponentiation operator raises one value to the power of another.

```python
a = 2
b = 3
print(a ** b)  # Output: 8
```
