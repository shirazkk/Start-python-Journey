# Assignment Operators
An assignment operator in Python is used to assign values to variables.

Lets discuss asssignment operators 

The most common assignment operator is `=`

This operator chnage the value of a variable 

**for example**
```python
a=22
a=34 # assign 34 in variable a
print(a) #output 34
```
---
second operator is `+=`
This operator is assign and increment in the prvious value 

**for example**
```python
a=33
a+=1 #increment in a it become 34
print(a)
```

same logic is use for all other operators `-=` subtract and assign value `*=` multiply and assign value
